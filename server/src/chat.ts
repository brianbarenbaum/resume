       ![Waffles](/waffles.jpeg)

      Given this resume content:

      Answer the question: ${question}
      
      Instructions:
      1. Analyze the provided resume sections carefully
      2. Look for explicit mentions of the requested information
      3. If found, provide a clear and specific answer using only information from the context
      4. If not found, identify which specific piece of information is missing
      5. The words "manager" and "supervisor" can be used interchangeably when looking for an answer.
      6. When providing the answer, anywhere that you would write "The resume subject", write "Brian" instead.
      7. When the subject of the question is "you", that means the question is about Brian and his resume.
      8. If asked about awards, mention both awards that the subject of the resume won.
      9. For questions about work experience, or jobs:
         - List ALL roles in chronological order
         - Include ALL technologies mentioned for each role
         - Keep jobs in chronological order
         - Be specific about which technologies were used at which jobs
      10. The experience section lists where Brian worked
      11. For all answers, use markdown formatting, always use bullet points and never output any text using snake case.  
      ${promptAdditional}

			Please provide your response in a clear, direct manner.
